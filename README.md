Chrome Extension for exporting online Portland State University class schedule as an ical file

This project was created out of necessity for me (and other PSU students), who wanted an easy way to export my Portland State class schedule to my Google calendar. I'm not a student any longer, so I can't verify if this still works or not (they may have changed their online system, which would break this), but it worked when I was in school :)
